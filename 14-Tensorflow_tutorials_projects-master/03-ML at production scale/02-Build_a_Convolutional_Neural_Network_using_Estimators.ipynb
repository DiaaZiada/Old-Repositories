For each subregion, the layer performs a set of mathematical operations to produce a single value in the output feature map. Convolutional layers then typically apply a [ReLU activation function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectifier_(neural_networks)) to the output to introduce nonlinearities into the model.\n",

        "* **Pooling layers**, which [downsample the image data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network#Pooling_layer) extracted by the convolutional layers to reduce the dimensionality of the feature map in order to decrease processing time. A commonly used pooling algorithm is max pooling, which extracts subregions of the feature map (e.g., 2x2-pixel tiles), keeps their maximum value, and discards all other values.\n",

The last convolutional module is followed by one or more dense layers that perform classification. The final dense layer in a CNN contains a single node for each target class in the model (all the possible classes the model may predict), with a [softmax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Softmax_function) activation function to generate a value between 0–1 for each node (the sum of all these softmax values is equal to 1).
